                          <p>I have worked in different teams in a Networking Project(Australian Client) at Infosys and my primary role initially was to design network entities using AutoCAD and update the database. Also, have done QA for 3 months.
                              Initially, all the editing of XML and update into the Database was done manually. It would take around one to two weeks to the manual work. Then we thought of automating it through VBA and then it processing of data took only 2-3 days instead of weeks. This was a huge achievement for our team as we had around 200 plus team members doing manual things before automation for around 1 year.
                              Efficiently worked in different projects of distinct domains with team size ranging from 4 to 10
                              members with unique roles and responsibilities.
