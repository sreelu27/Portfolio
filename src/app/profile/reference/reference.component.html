                      <p> I had an opportunity to work with Sreelekshmi in more than one project. She is hardworking, helpful, team player. She has good time management, analytical and leadership skills. She has the ability to get the correct solution whatever the problem comes. She applies the solution correctly. She learns new technologies very quickly and applies them in the project. In our project, she applied the design patterns properly with good scenarios which were very easy to understand by other team members.<p>We have worked two years togather in same project ,so i know him from my personal experience
                           Every person want this guy to be in his team.And as a persona I m sure company wont regret for hiring him
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            I learned many new things from her especially in the implementation of design patterns in a java project and solving a complex problem in the code. It's no doubt she will be a good asset for any company.

                            Above all, she is a good human being with honesty, humble, trustful, good heart. I wish her all the best for all future endeavours.

                        <p> Sreelekshmi is competent when it comes to technical knowledge. She can craft software solutions with what she has gained for her academic qualifications. Mainly I have seen her applying design patterns appropriately which is a challenging task for many software engineers. She is a quick learner too.</p>
                           <p>
                              So I can recommend assigning tasks involving new technologies to her with comfortable time frames since she can learn and apply the new technologies. I wish her good luck in her future endeavors and please contact me if you want further information.</p>
